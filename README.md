My personal dotfiles.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:fkwakkenbos/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
